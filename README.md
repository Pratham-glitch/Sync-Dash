# Sync-Dash
Sync Dash A hyper-casual endless runner with a unique real-time network synchronization twist.  Concept: "Sync Dash" challenges players to control a glowing cube automatically moving forward on the right side of the screen, tapping to jump over obstacles and collect glowing orbs for points. The innovative aspect lies on the left side of the screen, which features a "ghost" player. This ghost meticulously mirrors the player's actions (jumps, orb collections, obstacle collisions) in real-time, simulating network latency and smooth interpolation to create the illusion of a networked opponent without actual multiplayer servers. As the game progresses, the speed continuously increases, demanding faster reflexes and strategic play.  Key Features:  Core Gameplay: Navigate a glowing cube through an endless environment, jumping to avoid obstacles and collecting orbs.  Real-Time State Synchronization: Experience a locally simulated multiplayer environment where a ghost player on the left side of the screen precisely replicates the main player's actions with configurable network delay and smooth interpolation, showcasing robust state synchronization.  Dynamic Difficulty: Game speed incrementally increases over time, providing a continuously evolving challenge.  Score System: Earn points for distance traveled and collected orbs, with a separate score tracker for the ghost player.  Performance Optimization: Utilizes object pooling for obstacles and collectibles to ensure smooth gameplay and minimize frame drops.  Immersive Visuals:  Glowing Player Shader: The player cube features a distinct glowing effect.  Particle Effects: Visually engaging particle bursts upon orb collection and impactful explosions on obstacle collisions.  Dynamic Camera: Cameras follow their respective players with adjustable interpolation for a smooth, responsive feel.  Intuitive UI & Game Flow: Includes a clear main menu with "Start" and "Exit" options, and a "Game Over" screen with "Restart" and "Main Menu" buttons for seamless navigation.  Technologies Used:  Unity Engine (compatible with Unity 2021 or later)  C# Scripting
